# toy-k-means

This is a toy program for testing k-means algorithm

In this program, you can define the dimension of each data point by: 
  - KMeansTest<DATATYPE, 3> km; // 3-dimension data point

And define the center number k by:
  - #define K 10

Define data type is avaible, however, only float and integer type can be used.
  - #define DATATYPE float

Before testing this program, you should rewrite the pictures' path, and make sure that you have reconfigurated OpenCV's header and library path.  

This toy project works in OpenCV 3.1.0 and macbook air 13.
